        I have been <em>Generally</em> occupied with preparations for a crucial
        work presentation scheduled for 10:45 am Friday. This presentation is
        centered around a potential new client looking to purchase 26,000 tons
        of L-menthol. Our company is enthusiastic and eager to facilitate this
        opportunity and is committed to providing top-notch service to our new
        client. Moreover my company distributed a product, but regrettably, it
        becomes damaged prior to reaching the customer, resulting in a
        substantial loss for us last week. <strong>Libero</strong> is possible
        that I will be traveling to Turkey to address the issue regarding the
        damaged product. The workload has been increasing, but it is essential
        for me to handle it diligently as the product is intended for standard
        use. Have a great and productive end to the week and stay in touch!

        <span class="highlight"> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol… </span>The
        most important feature to learn and know is the URI. Our HTTP methods
        consist of four main methods which are Create(post), Read(get), Update,
        Delete… CRUD Create: It’s basically making & establishing something like
        making a post, or interacting with someone like in messages on social
        platform…!

      and not just scrolling through a webpage, and there is interaction because
