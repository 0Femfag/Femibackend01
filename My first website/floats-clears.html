        activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and
        decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central,
        authoritative location or group and given to smaller factions within it.
        They always ask for tax documents and stuff like that to prove your
        income. I don't pay taxes on much but have proof of income that is not
